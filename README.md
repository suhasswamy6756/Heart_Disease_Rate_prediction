# Heart Disease Rate Prediction

This project aims to predict the rate of heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## Description
The project involves analyzing a dataset related to heart disease and building a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of heart disease occurrence. The analysis and modeling are conducted using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation
To set up the environment and run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/suhasswamy6756/Heart_Disease_Rate_prediction
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Heart_Disease_Rate_prediction
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the notebook:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open `DM_Final.ipynb`.

3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and model prediction.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


These can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository. Ensure that the dataset file is located in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file path in the notebook accordingly.

## Results
The notebook includes detailed analysis and the final predictive model for heart disease rate prediction. Key results and findings are summarized within the notebook.
